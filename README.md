# codex

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill that delegates tasks to [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (GPT-5.5 by default; GPT-5.6 sol/terra/luna available) for precision coding, code review, deliberation, and complex implementation.

Codex runs as a background agent — launch a task, continue working, and collect results when ready.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured
- [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed (`npm install -g @openai/codex`)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY` set in your environment

## Installation

```bash
# Clone into your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/tomc98/claude-code-codex-skill ~/.claude/skills/codex
```

Or if you have the [skill-manager](https://github.com/tomc98/claude-code-skill-manager) skill:

```bash
# Via /skill-manager
/skill-manager install https://github.com/tomc98/claude-code-codex-skill
```

## What It Does

- **Two modes**: `think` (read-only deliberation + web search) and `run` (full-access coding agent)
- **Runs Codex non-interactively** via `codex exec`, capturing session IDs and clean output
- **Background execution** — every task launches in the background so Claude Code can keep working
- **Web search** — enabled by default on all commands for research and context
- **Image input** — pass screenshots and mockups to Codex via `--image`
- **Session management** — resume previous conversations with Codex by session ID or `--last`
- **Code review** — review uncommitted changes, diffs against branches, or specific commits
- **Structured output** — validate output against JSON Schema via `--schema`
- **Self-healing** — the skill auto-corrects itself when CLI behavior changes

## Usage

Once installed, Claude Code uses this skill automatically when delegating to Codex. You can also invoke it directly:

```
/codex think is this architecture scalable?
/codex review my uncommitted changes for security issues
/codex implement rate limiting for the upload endpoint
/codex refactor src/auth/ to use async/await
```

## Configuration

Codex is configured via `~/.codex/config.toml`. Recommended defaults:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.5"                       # default; GPT-5.6 family (gpt-5.6-terra/-sol/-luna) via --model
model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"

[features]
fast_mode = true
```

Override per-invocation with `--model`, `--effort` (GPT 5.6 adds `max`/`ultra`), or `--sandbox` flags.
